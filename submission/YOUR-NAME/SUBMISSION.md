# Midterm Submission Comments - **YOURNAME**

### 1. Describe how reward shaping affected training results in this environment. What were some pros and cons of the reward shaping?
Submit a graph of 2 training runs that show the win rate over time. Images can be put into markdown as follows: 
```

```

### 2. If there is no `_reward_shape` method used, what is the reward? (figure this out from the unwrapped env)
Write answer here.

### 3. Why is "action masking" needed in this environment? How is this implemented in the training setup? How does this affect the output of the Neural Network model?

Write answer here.

### 4. Methodology
Describe in detail your methodology for training the best policies to win in as many situations as possible.

### 5. Results
Describe the learning performance during training, and how you evaluated the policies after training--i.e. train performance and test performance. Use words and figures.
